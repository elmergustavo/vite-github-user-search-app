- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

### What I learned

I learned that react-query is awesome when you need to fetch things that will not change depending on the user's input. In fact, I started a battle against react-query itself! Awesome tool, but use it with caution.
